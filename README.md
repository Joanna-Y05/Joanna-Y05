**`Computer Science student (Game Dev/3D Modelling/programmer)`**

I am currently a second year university student studying Computer Science with Game Technology. I have a strong passion for game development and interactive design and i've worked on numerous programming and game projects, gaining extensive experience with Unity Engines, C# scripting, and Blender for 3D modelling and animation. I enjoy combining creativity with technical problem-solving to bring my ideas to life, and I am always looking to expand my skills in software development, game design, and graphics programming!
